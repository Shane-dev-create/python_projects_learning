## Description

This was my part of the project for WeThinkCode Bootcamp 2022.  
The goal was to create a username generator. A feature that generates a unique bootcamp username based on a format.


#### Technologies

## How To Use
The program should be structured in the following way:  
	1.	Your program should prompt a user to input Their First Name, Last Name, Campus and the cohort year they are entering. - It is your choice how you will expect this input, one by one or in a single string  
	2.	Your program should validate user input in the following ways:  
	-a.	First name and last name name should not contain digits  
	-b.	Campus should be a valid campus  
	-c.	Cohort year should be a valid cohort year - a candidate canâ€™t join a cohort in the past  
	3.	You will have a function that produces the username from the input provided.  
	4.	The user will then be asked if the final username is correct. Let them know what the format of the username is and if the final username is correct.  

See below for an example of the final bootcamp username based on personal information:  

First Name: Lungelo  

Last Name: Mkhize  

Cohort Year: 2022  

Final Campus: Durban  

Final username: elomkhDBN2022  

ELO - Last 3 letters of first name (if their name is less than 3 letters you should add the letter O at the end)  

MKH - First 3 letters of their last name (if their name is less than 3 letters you should add the letter O at the end)  

DBN - Final Campus selection - Johannesburg is JHB, Cape Town is CPT, Durban is DBN, Phokeng is PHO  

2022 - The cohort year they are entering
